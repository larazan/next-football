Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.</p><p>10.5 No Class Actions. You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and you may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this subsection’s limitations as to a given dispute, claim, or request for relief, then such aspect must be severed from the arbitration and brought into the State or Federal Courts located in the State of Utah. All other disputes, claims, or requests for relief shall be arbitrated.</p><p className="font-bold">SECTION 11 – MISCELLANEOUS</p><p>11.1 Waiver. Instasize’s failure to enforce any of its rights or act with respect to a breach of the terms of this Agreement by you or others does not constitute a waiver of any rights and will not limit Instasize’s rights with respect to that breach or any subsequent breaches. No waiver by Instasize shall be of any force or effect unless made in writing and signed by a duly authorized officer of Instasize.</p><p>11.2 Assignment.
